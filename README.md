# Newsapi
This is a webapp which allows the user to search news articles from different countries. 
It uses newsapi as its data source. 
In order to search for headlines, the user must choose from one of 3 categories: Technology, sports, or entertainment. 
If no category is selected, an error message will be displayed.
The user may then choose to type in a keyword to search for something specific. For example, if they wanted to search for news
about baseball, they could type in "baseball" for baseball related news. They may also choose to leave this blank, in case
they want news for all of that particular category.

The user may also choose a particular country that they want data from. The user also has an option to choose from global news.
Once the user has made their selections, they need to press submit and their news articles will be displayed. 
Up to 100 articles are displayed. Five articles are displayed at a time, and the user can click "next 5" or "prev 5" to go back and forth.
Clicking a link will open the news article in a new tab. If the user would like to search for more articles, they may reenter their desired
entries and click submit once again.
